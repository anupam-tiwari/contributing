# Reviewing PRs

## Guidelines

1. The first review should be throughout, so upcoming reviews become smaller
2. Avoid adding new requirements to existing PRs, the code should be evaluated based on the acceptance criteria
3. Share concise but direct feedback: strike a good balance between a short yet understandable message
