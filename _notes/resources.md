## Machine Learning courses

- [Machine Learning with Python: A Practical Introduction](https://www.edx.org/course/machine-learning-with-python-a-practical-introduct). Practical course (not much math involved) that covers the most important concepts and has sample Jupyter notebooks
- [Machine Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-introduction). Three course series on Coursera, they are more math-heavy (requires linear algebra and calculus)
- [scikit-learn docs](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/). scikit-learn documentation contains a lot of explanations for various Machine Learning concepts.
